To read the Joint_Observations Google Sheet into a pandas DataFrame, save it to a .h5 file, read the .h5 file, select the desired entries (one or more lines of the spreadsheet) and create the list of MAGIC and LST runs (.txt files) to be used by the scripts. New dependencies, Google API configuration and sharing of the Google document (so, LST/MAGIC credentials...) are needed to use it, so please let me know if you want to try it (or you need to use it)
